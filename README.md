## Abstract
Project that allows the interaction with spherical images by hand gestures, using a [LeapMotion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) device. It contains three (although they can be enlarged) images adapted to a sphere, through which different displacements can be made.

The different gestures and their mission are:
- Tilt your hand to move.
- Join a fist with the palm of the other hand to move on to the next scene.
- Separate or join the fists to zoom.
- Extend two fingers to return to the original position.
- Raise your palm to go to the menu.
